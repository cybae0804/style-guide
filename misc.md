### Alphabetize
- Alphabetize all properties in an object. This is the only objective way of sorting properties; semantic ordering can be subjective depending on the author.
- There's an argument for certain properties to be prioritized, such as `type` or `key` for React.
- There are linter rules that can handle this automatically.

### Single item files
- Create smaller files with single code that matches the name of the file. Makes navigation a lot easier.
- Ex. `function getValue` inside `getValue.ts`
